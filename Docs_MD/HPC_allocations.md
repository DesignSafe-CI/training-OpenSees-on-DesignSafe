# Allocations

This guide explains what TACC allocations are, who can apply, how to request them, and where to find more resources for the **TACC**.
***NOTE:** The contents of this section are informational and may have been superceded.*



A **TACC allocation** is a grant of computing resources—such as CPU/GPU time, storage space, or access to specific systems—on TACC’s supercomputers.
Basically, it’s how researchers, educators, or students get access to TACC’s powerful systems (like Stampede3) to run simulations, analyze large datasets, or train machine learning models.


These resources are used for tasks like:

- Scientific simulations
- Data analysis
- AI/ML model training
- Engineering computations
- Educational instruction


## Why Are Allocations Needed?

TACC’s systems are shared resources, meaning many people use them. To make sure resources are used fairly and efficiently, TACC requires users to apply for and receive allocations based on their project needs.

Think of it like reserving time on a shared telescope or lab equipment—you need to justify how much time you need and why.



## What’s Included in an Allocation?

| Resource Type     | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **CPU hours**     | Compute time on HPC nodes for simulations or data processing |
| **GPU hours**     | Time on GPU nodes for deep learning, molecular dynamics, etc. |
| **Storage space** | Space for input/output files, data sets, models, etc. |
| **Access rights** | Permission to use specific TACC systems linked to your project |



## How to Request DesignSafe Allocations

DesignSafe provides many HPC-enabled Tools & Apps that require an allocation of computing time. Upon navigating to one of these, such as OpenSeesMP, and clicking on "Get Started" you will see a banner informing you to submit a ticket requesting an allocation if you don't already have one.
