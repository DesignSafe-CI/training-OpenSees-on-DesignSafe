# About this Document
This document is organized into two complementary parts:

1. **Computational Workflows and Resources**
The first part introduces the computational ecosystem of DesignSafe and TACC — explaining how resources are organized, how jobs move through the system, and how users can develop efficient, scalable workflows. In this section, we will introduce the main computational environments (such as JupyterHub and the HPC systems), the file storage structure that supports data movement and persistence, and the Tapis middleware that connects user interfaces to compute resources. Together, these components form the foundation for running interactive analyses, batch simulations, and automated workflows across DesignSafe and TACC.

By understanding these layers, you’ll gain a clear view of how DesignSafe supports everything from interactive development to high-performance batch computation.

2. **Running OpenSees on DesignSafe Training Modules**
The second part provides a hands-on training module for running OpenSees analyses on DesignSafe, leveraging both the web portal and the HPC systems at TACC. It walks you through model preparation, job submission, monitoring, and result retrieval — all within the DesignSafe ecosystem. The examples focus on OpenSees (Tcl, OpenSeesPy, OpenSeesMP, and OpenSeesSP), but the same concepts apply broadly to other simulation workflows.

Together, these two sections form both a reference guide and a training path: the first helps you understand how the system works, and the second helps you put that understanding into practice.

As new applications and capabilities are added to DesignSafe, additional training modules will expand this collection — building a growing library of practical resources for researchers, students, and developers who want to take full advantage of the DesignSafe–TACC computational infrastructure.
