# Training Material


## Using the Training Notebooks

Many of the pages in this training module are **generated directly from Jupyter notebooks**. These notebooks are designed to be **templates for your own work** — you should *never start from scratch*. Instead:

* The notebooks are stored in the **DesignSafe Community Data folder**.
  * You can run them there, but you **cannot save changes** in Community Data.
  * Also, some notebooks include inputs such as job definitions or file paths that are specific to *my user account*.
    
* To work effectively, you should **copy the notebooks** to your own storage (e.g., **\~/MyData**).
* **Edit, duplicate, or modify** the appropriate cells to fit your workflow.

You can recognize a notebook-based page because it has an **“Open in DesignSafe”** button at the very top. Clicking it will bring you to **JupyterHub in DesignSafe**, where you’ll be prompted to log in (or create an account). I recommend copying **only relevant notebooks in the folder** into your path, as I may be editing the existing notebooks or adding new ones.

## Python Function Library

Alongside the notebooks, this training relies on a **custom library of Python functions** that I have developed. This library is stored in **DesignSafe Community Data** and is used extensively throughout the modules.

* You *can* copy the library directly from Community Data, but I **don’t recommend it**, since I am continually updating and improving it.
* Instead, look at the **script near the top of any notebook** that uses the library — copy that snippet into your own path so you can use a stable version of the library in your work.
