# Run OpenSees in CLI

Running an OpenSees at the command line allows you to test the program and make sure you have set up the right environment. This is ideal for:

* Testing syntax or exploring commands in real time
* Building a small model step-by-step
* Debugging specific lines of code without running an entire script
