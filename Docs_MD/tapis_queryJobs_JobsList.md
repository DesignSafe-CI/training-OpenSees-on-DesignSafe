# Step 1: Explore All Jobs
***General Queries getJobList()***

The first step in working with Tapis jobs is to **get an overview of all your past and current runs**. Using `getJobList()`, you can retrieve summary metadata such as job IDs, owners, applications used, creation dates, and statuses. This broad view is useful for:

* Building a searchable index or DataFrame of jobs,
* Filtering by status (e.g., only finished or failed jobs), and
* Deciding which jobs to examine in more detail.

Think of this as your **dashboard view**: it gives you a wide-angle snapshot of your work across Tapis before zooming into specific jobs.

The **getJobList()** method retrieves a list of jobs, which can be filtered using a variety of fields. This is typically your first step when exploring job data.

**Example Use:**

```python
jobs = client.jobs.getJobList()
for job in jobs:
    print(job.id, job.status, job.created)
```

Each job is returned as a **TapisResult object**, which can be inspected with:

```python
job = jobs[0]
print(dir(job))          # All attributes
print(job.__dict__)      # Dictionary view
```
