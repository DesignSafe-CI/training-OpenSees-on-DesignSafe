# Explore Tapis Apps
***Exploring Tapis Apps with Notebooks***

We have already introduced **Tapis Apps** — the packaged definitions that describe how to run software on DesignSafe’s compute systems. Each app includes information such as its executable, required modules, inputs, parameters, and outputs.

This training module provides two companion notebooks that let you **explore available apps interactively**:

1. **List Tapis Apps**

   * Queries Tapis to return all apps you have permission to see.
   * Helps you identify which versions are current and available on DesignSafe.

2. **Get App Schema**

   * Retrieves the full JSON schema for a selected app.
   * Shows details about the app’s parameters, inputs, and configuration options.
   * Useful when you want to understand exactly how to structure a job submission.

These notebooks are meant to be used as **templates**. Rather than starting from scratch, you can copy, edit, and adapt them to fit your own workflows. Together, they give you a practical way to inspect apps before running jobs — making it easier to confirm requirements, troubleshoot errors, and customize submissions.
