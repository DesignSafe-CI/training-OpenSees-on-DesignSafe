# DesignSafe & TACC

**DesignSafe** offers a comprehensive environment for conducting, managing, and analyzing workflows related to natural hazards engineering. It combines interactive tools, data services, and computational resources to support your entire research lifecycle — from model development to large-scale simulations to advanced post-processing.

At its core, DesignSafe is tightly integrated with the **Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)**, which supplies the <u>high-performance computing (HPC) systems and large-scale storage</u> required to execute demanding analyses. Most jobs submitted through DesignSafe — whether via the web portal, Jupyter notebooks, or automated pipelines — ultimately run on TACC’s powerful supercomputers like **Stampede3**, making it possible to carry out simulations that would be unfeasible on local machines.

DesignSafe’s platform is built with **flexibility and scalability in mind**: whether you are testing small models interactively or deploying large-scale simulations across thousands of cores, the system adapts to your needs.

To make the most of this power, you need to understand how jobs move through the system — from the interfaces you use, to the compute environments where they execute, to the middleware that links the two.
