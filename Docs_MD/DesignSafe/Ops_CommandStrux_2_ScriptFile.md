# Input Script File (Non-Interactive)
***Non-Interactive Mode with Script Files (Optional)***

When you run OpenSees or OpenSeesPy with a script file as the first argument, the program will **exit automatically once the script finishes executing**. This is known as **Non-Interactive Mode** — the file is read from top to bottom, and all commands are executed without any additional user input.

This is the **recommended and most common** method for running OpenSees, especially for batch jobs and large analyses.

Even on interactive platforms like **Jupyter**, if you run an entire script in one command, you’re still operating in non-interactive mode.
However, you can combine the convenience of an *input file* with the flexibility of an interactive workflow by loading OpenSeesPy commands directly into notebook cells. This approach lets you develop and refine your models while integrating **graphics, plots, and visualizations** alongside your code.

> **Note:** For large-scale runs on HPC systems, non-interactive mode is the default and most reliable execution style.

---

## Use Cases

  * Full model execution
  * Reproducible simulations
  * Running jobs on HPC or cloud environments
    
## **Sequential Execution**

| Language   | Command                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Tcl        | *OpenSees inputfile.tcl*                           |
| OpenSeesPy | *python inputfile.py* *                            |

* *import OpenSeesPy inside*

### Demo
::::{dropdown} Run Script in Terminal

Most OpenSees analyses are run in **non-interactive mode**, where you execute a full input script all at once. Even if you’re in an interactive environment like Jupyter, running a script this way means the entire sequence of commands executes without waiting for further input. Jupyter Hub has an integrated editor to make things easy.

You can run therefore, run both OpenSees(Tcl) and OpenSeesPy (Python) in non-interactive, batch mode at the terminal's CLI by specifying the input script to execute. In both cases, the first argument provided after the executable is interpreted as the **main script file** to run.

Most OpenSees Analyses require that you work with an input script that you can edit as needed to fix errors and add features.
Being able to work with this script in an interactive environment allows to have immediate feedback on your changes.

This is your starting place. Develop your script for a few test cases.

The following images show how to run OpenSees Tcl and OpenSeesPy at the terminal for both sequential and parallel analyses.
