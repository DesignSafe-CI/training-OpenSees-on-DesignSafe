Legend (symbols):
- 🖥️ Run interactively (small jobs, direct access in terminal or notebook)
- 💻 Run via OS package or shell commands in Jupyter Notebook (e.g. `!opensees`, `subprocess`)
- ⚙️ Run via MPI (parallel execution for small or large jobs)
- 📤 Submit jobs to VM, HPC, or Launcher
- 🔶 Less efficient method
- 🔴 Not available
- – Feature planned or not yet supported

Footnotes:


ᵃ OpenSees-Express runs in its own dedicated shared-resource VM. It only has one node and few processors. -- **NO QUEUE**<br>
ᵇ The current Execution System on DesignSafe for the Web Portal is Stampede3. It requires an **Allocation + QUEUE Wait**<br>
ᶜ Jupyter Hub runs on its own dedicated shared-resource VM   -- **NO QUEUE Wait**<br>
ᵈ Jupyter Hub has options for Python, MATLAB, R, and Julia  <br>
ᵉ TACC has more Execution Systems and queues. It requires an **Allocation + QUEUE Wait**<br>
