<!-- # Accessing the Terminal


There are several ways to access the Terminal CLI, depending on your system and environment:

## On your local computer 
- In Windows, use Command Prompt (*cmd*), PowerShell, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).  
- In macOS or Linux, open the **Terminal** app from your applications menu.


## In Jupyter Environment 

- Access the terminal through the **Jupyter interface** by clicking “New > Terminal” in the Jupyter file browser or clicking the Terminal icon in the Launcher.

## **In HPC Environment**:
- Access the command line in the HPC systems such as Stampede3 via ssh. This method is presented elsewhere.

<!-- ## Basic Linux Commands

Here are the basic commands you **may** need when navigating the CLI in a linux environment:

```
mkdir dirname          : make a new directory
cd dirname             : change directory
pwd                    : returns current directory
ls                     : list files 
cp origFile newFile    : copy a file
mv origFile newFile    : move a file
rm filename            : remove a file
wc –l directoryname    : how many files in a directory 
wc –l filename         : how many lines in a file 
```

**Tip:** In Jupyter Hub, you can do most file operations through the navigation pane, but knowing these commands is crucial for work on the HPC.
