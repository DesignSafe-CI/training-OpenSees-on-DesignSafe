# OpenSeesPy Parallel

***Options for MultiProcess OpenSeesPy***

Running OpenSeesPy in parallel can dramatically reduce run times for large models or many independent simulations.
The optimal method depends on:

* **Interaction needs** ‚Äì Do tasks share data (MPI) or run independently?
* **Execution environment** ‚Äì Local machine, HPC system, or Jupyter?
* **Control level** ‚Äì Simple launch vs. fine-grained process coordination?

The table below summarizes when to use each approach.

### How to Choose

* Need **full MPI** and minimal code changes? ‚Üí **Built-in MPI**
* Need **custom MPI logic** in Python? ‚Üí **mpi4py**
* Jobs are **independent**? ‚Üí **concurrent.futures**

### Parallel Methods

:::{dropdown} 1. Built-in MPI in OpenSeesPy

OpenSeesPy comes with optional MPI functionality compiled in. To use it, run your script with *mpiexec*, just like you would with OpenSeesMP:

```
mpiexec -n 4 python model.py
```

Inside your script:

```
ops.start()
pid = ops.getPID()
np = ops.getNP()      
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This MPI method may not work well in **Jupyter Notebooks** or certain IDEs, due to how those environments handle parallel processes. It **does** work reliably on HPC systems like **Stampede3**.

:::

:::{dropdown} 2. Using the *mpi4py* Python Package

An alternative and flexible method is to use the *mpi4py* package. This allows you to directly control MPI behavior within Python, giving you more custom control over communication and process logic.

You still run the script using *mpiexec*:

```
mpiexec -n 4 python model_mpi4py.py
```

Inside your script:

```
from mpi4py import MPI
comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
size = comm.Get_size()
```

This gives you access to each process's rank and the total number of processes, allowing you to divide and coordinate tasks.

:::

::::{dropdown} 3. Optional: Parallel Execution via *concurrent.futures*

If your tasks are **independent** (e.g., many separate simulations), you don't need full MPI.

You can instead use Python's built-in *concurrent.futures* module to manage multiple subprocesses in parallel.

Example:

```
import os
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

def run_simulation(job_id):
    os.system(f'python input_Parallel_concurrent_futures.py {job_id}')

with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    executor.map(run_simulation, range(4))
```

This approach is ideal for **Monte Carlo simulations**, **parameter studies**, or **batch runs** where the simulations don't need to communicate with each other.

Works with both *python* and *OpenSees* commands:

```
os.system("OpenSees model.tcl")
```

```
os.system("python model.py")
```

:::{dropdown} concurrent.futures & multiple nodes

Does concurrent.futures run on multiple nodes? Not by itself.

**concurrent.futures** in its standard form only works within the **boundaries of a single Python process on one machine (or one compute node)**.

Here‚Äôs why:

* The **ProcessPoolExecutor** in the standard library uses Python‚Äôs **multiprocessing** module under the hood.
* **multiprocessing works by spawning processes on the local machine only ‚Äî it has no built-in ability to start processes on remote nodes.**
* On HPC systems, when you run a job across multiple nodes, each node has its own operating system instance and process space ‚Äî local-only executors can‚Äôt cross that boundary.

---

**Ways to make it multi-node:**
If you want something *like* concurrent.futures but across nodes, you‚Äôd need:

1. **MPI-based execution** ‚Äî where processes are distributed across nodes via **mpiexec** or **srun** and communicate using MPI (this is what OpenSeesMP and mpi4py do).
2. **Task schedulers / frameworks** such as:

   * **Dask** (*dask.distributed*)
   * **Ray**
   * **Parsl** (used in some HPC workflows)
   * **Job arrays** in SLURM ‚Äî run many independent jobs, each on its own node, all launched from one script.

---

üí° **Bottom line:**
If your runs are truly *embarrassingly parallel* **and** you want them on multiple HPC nodes, you can:

* Use **SLURM job arrays** or
* Wrap your **concurrent.futures** call inside an MPI job so each MPI process runs its own local executor (hybrid approach).

```{admonition} Key Notes
- **Built-in MPI** ‚Üí Minimal code changes, good for full parallel models, best on HPC/terminal.  
- **mpi4py** ‚Üí Maximum MPI control, custom communication, more coding effort.  
- **concurrent.futures** ‚Üí Best for independent jobs, works anywhere, no MPI needed.  
- Jupyter is best for **independent jobs**; for MPI, prefer HPC batch or terminal.  
```
