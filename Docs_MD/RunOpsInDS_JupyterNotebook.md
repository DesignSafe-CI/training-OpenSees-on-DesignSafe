# OpenSees & Notebooks

***Interactive Development for OpenSees + Seamless HPC Scaling  on DesignSafe***

Jupyter Notebooks offer an **interactive, visual, and self-documenting workflow**, making them one of the most versatile ways to develop with OpenSees on DesignSafe. They allow you to combine **code, documentation, plots, and results** in a single file that can be shared, rerun, and extended.

---

## Why Use Jupyter Notebooks?

Best suited for OpenSeesPy users working with:

* *matplotlib* or *plotly* for visualization
* *pandas*, *numpy*, and *scipy* for numerical tasks
* Integrated workflows that need pre-processing, execution, and post-processing in one place

Ideal for:

* Educational content and tutorials
* Reports and documentation
* Rapid prototyping and validation of models

---

## Interactive Mode (Single Node)

When you run commands cell by cell in a notebook, you are in **Interactive Mode**.

* Only **OpenSeesPy (Python)** runs interactively this way.
* Limited to the resources of your JupyterHub container (**single node, up to 8 cores and 20 GB RAM**).
* Great for experimentation, debugging, and incremental model building.
* Not suitable for large, parallel, or multi-node jobs.

This is conceptually the same as typing commands into a Python console, except you get the added benefit of mixing in plots, markdown explanations, and outputs in one document.

---

## Non-Interactive Mode (Script Execution)

From a notebook, you can also execute **entire Tcl or Python scripts** as shell commands.

* This works for **both Tcl (*OpenSees*) and Python (*python*) versions** of OpenSees.
* Running a script this way is **non-interactive**: the program starts, reads the script top to bottom, then exits.
* Even in Jupyter, if you run a full script, you‚Äôre in non-interactive mode.
* This is the most common way to launch analyses ‚Äî especially for batch jobs or large models.

Examples:

```bash
!OpenSees model.tcl arg1 arg2
```

```bash
!python model.py arg1 arg2
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: In this mode, variables defined inside the script do **not** persist in your notebook‚Äôs Python kernel, since they run in a separate process.

---

## Caveats of Notebooks

While powerful, notebooks do come with some quirks:

* **Kernel state inconsistencies** ‚Äî variables may persist unexpectedly between cells, leading to confusion.
* **Out-of-order execution** ‚Äî running cells out of sequence can produce misleading results.
* **Migration issues** ‚Äî notebooks often require cleanup when moving workflows to batch jobs.
* **Single-node only** ‚Äî interactive execution is limited to one container; you must use Tapis to scale.

---

## Scaling Up with Tapis (HPC Mode)

The **recommended way** to move from prototyping to production is to submit jobs directly from a notebook to **TACC HPC systems** using **Tapis** (the Python-accessible API).

* Works for both Tcl and Python OpenSees scripts.
* Makes your workflow **seamlessly scalable** ‚Äî prototype interactively, then submit to HPC without leaving the notebook.
* Supports multi-node parallel jobs (OpenSeesMP, OpenSeesPy + MPI).
* Lets you monitor, retrieve, and post-process results from the same notebook environment.

Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **Recommended Practices** subsection you can drop at the end of your Jupyter Notebook section. It ties back to your CLI and console material while giving readers a clear workflow strategy:

### Recommended Practices

* **Start Interactive in Jupyter**
  Use Jupyter notebooks with **OpenSeesPy interactively** (cell-by-cell) when learning, debugging, or building small models. The combination of code, plots, and documentation makes it the best environment for exploration.

* **Test with Scripts Inside the Notebook**
  Once a model grows, run Tcl or Python scripts in **non-interactive mode** from your notebook using shell calls. This mimics how your job will behave in production, but keeps testing convenient.

* **Transition to Tapis for Scale**
  When ready for larger workloads, submit jobs to **HPC via Tapis** directly from the notebook. This ensures:

  * Reliable execution on multi-core and multi-node systems
  * No kernel state issues
  * A seamless path from prototype to production

* **Keep Scripts Modular**
  Write your models in clean, reusable Tcl or Python files. In notebooks, focus on orchestration, visualization, and workflow control rather than putting the entire model inline.

* **Document Your Workflow**
  Treat notebooks as living lab books ‚Äî record assumptions, parameters, plots, and results. This is invaluable for sharing with collaborators or revisiting analyses later.

üëâ Notebooks are not not a replacement for scripts or HPC, they are the **hub** where development, documentation, and scaling all come together.
