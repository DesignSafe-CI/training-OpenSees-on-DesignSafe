As a unified platform for natural hazards engineering, **DesignSafe** supports the full research lifecycle by integrating interactive tools, data management services, and high-performance computing resources. Whether you're developing models, running large-scale simulations, or conducting detailed post-processing, DesignSafe provides the infrastructure to streamline and scale your workflow.

In this training module we will focus on **OpenSees**. Not just because of its power and popularity in earthquake engineering, but because it provides an ideal case study for scalable computational workflows. Built from the ground up for parallel execution and flexible scripting, OpenSees illustrates many common challenges and opportunities faced by researchers in other fields — such as managing complex input files, launching parameter studies, and organizing results across systems.

While OpenSees is the featured example throughout this module, **the real emphasis is on the complete Scientific Workflow lifecycle**. You’ll gain hands-on experience with the tools and strategies required to build, manage, submit, monitor, and scale computational research — from small exploratory runs to fully automated HPC pipelines. The goal is to help you understand and orchestrate every step of the workflow, regardless of the specific application.

These foundational concepts are widely transferable: whether you’re working with CFD solvers, climate models, structural simulations, or your own custom software, **DesignSafe’s workflow infrastructure enables scalable, reproducible, and automated research.**
