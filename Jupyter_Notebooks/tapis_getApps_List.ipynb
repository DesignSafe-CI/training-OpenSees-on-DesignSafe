    "The *getApps()* command in the Tapis API allows you to retrieve a list of registered applications, but it’s more than a simple list function. It supports **query parameters** that let you filter and control what gets returned — making it easier to find only the apps you care about.\n",

    "* **App ID or partial ID**\n",
