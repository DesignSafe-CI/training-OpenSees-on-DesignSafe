# Tapis App Output
***Outputs in a Tapis App Template***

**Outputs** describe the files that your application is expected to produce after it runs. While they are not directly injected into the wrapper script like inputs and parameters, they are declared in the app definition so Tapis knows what to expect, archive, and expose to users after a job completes.

Outputs play an important role in enabling data tracking, automated workflows, and downstream analysis.

## What Outputs Do

* **Advertise** what files an app is expected to generate (e.g., a report, result file, or log)
* **Support archiving** by helping Tapis know what to save and where to put it
* **Enable workflows**, where the output of one job becomes the input to another

Tapis collects and archives all files created during the job, but explicitly declaring outputs improves discoverability and consistency across jobs.

## Key Properties of an Output

Outputs are defined in the `outputs` array of the `app-definition.json` file.

| Field                 | Description                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                  | Identifier for the output (used for metadata, not in the wrapper)       |
| `value.default`       | The default name/path of the expected output file (e.g., `results.out`) |
| `value.required`      | Whether the app must produce this output to be valid                    |
| `value.visible`       | Whether to show this output in the UI                                   |
| `value.validator`     | Regex to match the output file name(s)                                  |
| `semantics.fileTypes` | Type of file (e.g., `"raw-0"`)                                          |
| `details.label`       | Friendly name shown to users                                            |
| `details.description` | Description or tooltip in the UI                                        |

> ⚠️ **Note:** Output IDs are not injected into the wrapper script. If you need to set a filename during execution, pass it in as a parameter instead.

```json

  "id": "sortedFile",
  "value": {
    "default": "sorted_results.out",
    "required": true,
    "visible": true
  },
  "semantics": {
    "fileTypes": ["raw-0"]

    "label": "Sorted Output File",
    "description": "The sorted result file generated by the app"
  }
}
```

## Archiving and Access

Once a job completes, Tapis automatically:

* Collects the job's output files (including the declared ones)
* Moves them to the user’s archive system and path
* Exposes them in the DesignSafe web portal or via the Tapis Files API

You can browse, download, or reference these outputs in follow-up jobs or workflows.
