:::{dropdown} **containerArgs** Attributes
:::

:::{dropdown} **schedulerOptions** Attributes
from: (Tapis Jobs Documentation)[https://tapis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/jobs.html]

Specify HPC batch scheduler arguments for the container runtime using the schedulerOptions parameter. Arguments specified in the application definition are appended to those in the submission request. The arguments for each scheduler are passed using that scheduler’s conventions.

Tapis defines a special scheduler option, --tapis-profile, to support local scheduler conventions. Data centers sometimes customize their schedulers or restrict how those schedulers can be used. The Systems service manages SchedulerProfile resources that are separate from any system definition, but can be referenced from system definitions. The Jobs service uses directives contained in profiles to tailor application execution to local requirements.

As an example, below is the JSON input used to create the TACC scheduler profile.

The moduleLoads array contains one or more objects. Each object contains a moduleLoadCommand, which specifies the local command used to load each of the modules (in order) in its modulesToLoad list.

The hiddenOptions array identifies scheduler options that the local implementation prohibits. Options specified here will have the corresponding Slurm option suppressed. Supported options are “MEM” for --mem and “PARTITION” for --partition. Including an option in the array indicates that the corresponding Slurm option should never be passed through to Slurm.

```
{
    "name": "TACC",
    "owner": "user1",
    "description": "Test profile for TACC Slurm",
    "moduleLoads": [
        {
            "moduleLoadCommand": "module load",
            "modulesToLoad": ["tacc-singularity"]
        }
    ],
    "hiddenOptions": ["MEM"]
}
```

Scheduler-Specific Processing: Jobs will perform macro-substitution on Slurm scheduler options --job-name or -J. This substitution allows Slurm job names to be dynamically generated before submitting them.

:::{dropdown} **envVariables** (KeyValuePair) Attributes

Specify key-value pairs that will be injected as environment variables into the application’s container when it is launched. Key-value pairs specified in the execution system definition, application definition, and job submission request are aggregated using precedence ordering (system < app < request) to resolve conflicts.

Both the key and value are required, though the value can be an empty string. Descriptions are optional but if present must contain 1 or more characters.

| Attribute   | Type   | Example         | Notes           |
| ----------- | ------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| key         | String | INPUT\_FILE     | Environment variable name. Required. |
| value       | String | /tmp/file.input | Environment variable value           |
| description | String |                 | Optional Description       |
| inputMode   | enum   | REQUIRED        | As in Arg table<br>* Indicates how argument is to be treated when processing individual job requests.<br>* Modes: REQUIRED, FIXED, INCLUDE_ON_DEMAND, INCLUDE_BY_DEFAULT<br>* Default is INCLUDE_BY_DEFAULT.<br>* REQUIRED: Must be provided in a job request or application definition.<br>* FIXED: Not overridable in application or job request.<br>* INCLUDE_ON_DEMAND: Included if referenced in a job request.<br>* INCLUDE_BY_DEFAULT: Included unless include=false in a job request.|
| notes       | String | {}              | Simple metadata in the form of a Json object.<br>* Not used by Tapis.   |

:::{dropdown} ***inputMode***
Applications use their AppArgSpecs to pass default values to job requests. 

The AppArgSpec’s inputMode determines how to handle arguments during job processing. An inputMode field can have these values:

* **REQUIRED**
The argument must be provided for the job to run. If an arg value is not specified in the application definition, then it must be specified in the job request. When provided in both, the job request arg value overrides the one in application.

* **FIXED**
The argument is completely defined in the application and not overridable in a job request.

* **INCLUDE_ON_DEMAND**
The argument, if complete, will only be included in the final argument list constructed by Jobs if it’s explicitly referenced and included in the Job request. This is the default value.

* **INCLUDE_BY_DEFAULT**
The argument, if complete, will automatically be included in the final argument list constructed by Jobs unless explicitly excluded in the Job request.

:::{dropdown} **archiveFilter** Attributes

The archiveFilter conforms to this JSON schema:
```
"archiveFilter": {
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
      "includes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1}, "uniqueItems": true},
      "excludes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1}, "uniqueItems": true},
      "includeLaunchFiles": {"type": "boolean"}
   },
   "additionalProperties": false
}
```

An archiveFilter can be specified in the application definition and/or the job submission request. The includes and excludes arrays are merged by appending entries from the application definition to those in the submission request.

The excludes filter is applied first, so it takes precedence over includes. If excludes is empty, then no output file or directory will be explicitly excluded from archiving. If includes is empty, then all files in execSystemOutputDir will be archived unless explicitly excluded. If includes is not empty, then only files and directories that match an entry and not explicitly excluded will be archived.

Each includes and excludes entry is a string, a string with wildcards or a regular expression. Entries represent directories or files. The wildcard semantics are that of glob (*), which is commonly used on the command line. Tapis implements Java glob semantics. To filter using a regular expression, construct the pattern using Java regex semantics and then preface it with REGEX: (case sensitive). Here are examples of globs and regular expressions that could appear in a filter:

```
"myfile.*"
"*2021-*-events.log"
"REGEX:^[\\p{IsAlphabetic}\\p{IsDigit}_\\.\\-]+$"
"REGEX:\\s+"
```

When includeLaunchFiles is true (the default), then the script (tapisjob.sh) and environment (tapisjob.env) files that Tapis generates in the execSystemExecDir are also archived. These launch files provide valuable information about how a job was configured and launched, so archiving them can help with debugging and improve reproducibility. Since these files may contain application secrets, such database passwords or other credentials, care must be taken to not expose private data through archiving.

If no filtering is specified at all, then all files in execSystemOutputDir and the launch files are archived.


| Attribute          | Type      | Notes                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| includes           | \[String] | Files to include when archiving after execution of the application.<br>* excludes list has precedence.                                      |
| excludes           | \[String] | Files to skip when archiving after execution of the application.<br>* excludes list has precedence.                   |
| includeLaunchFiles | boolean   | Indicates if Tapis generated launch scripts are to be included when archiving.

The default is TRUE. |

:::{dropdown} **logConfig** Spec
A LogConfig can be supplied in the job submission request and/or in the application definition, with the former overriding the latter when both are supplied. In supported runtimes (currently Singularity and ZIP), the logConfig parameter can be used to redirect the application container’s stdout and stderr to user-specified files.

:::{dropdown} **MPI** and Related Support

On many systems, running Message Passing Interface (MPI) jobs is simply a matter of launching programs that have been configured or compiled with the proper MPI libraries. Most of the work in employing MPI involves parallelizing program logic and specifying the correct libraries for the target execution system. Once that is done, a command such as mpirun (or on TACC systems, ibrun) is passed the program’s pathname and arguments to kick off parallel execution.

Tapis’s mpiCmd parameter lets users set the MPI launch command in a system definition, application definition and/or job submission request (lowest to highest priority). For example, if mpiCmd=mpirun, then the string “mpirun ” will be prepended to the command normally used to execute the application. Some MPI launchers have their own parameters, for instance, mpiCmd=ibrun -n 4 requests 4 MPI tasks.

The isMpi parameter is specified in an application definition and/or job request to toggle MPI launching on or off. This switch allows the same system to run both MPI and non-MPI jobs depending on the needs of particular jobs or applications. The isMpi default is false, so this switch must be explicitly turned on to run an MPI job. When turned on, isMpi requires cmdMpi be assigned in the system, application and/or job request.

The cmdPrefix parameter provides generalized support for launchers and is available in application definitions and job submission requests. Like mpiCmd, a cmdPrefix value is simply prepended to a program’s pathname and arguments. Being more general, cmdPrefix could specify an MPI launcher, but it’s not supported in system definitions and does not have a toggle to control usage.

mpiCmd and cmdPrefix are mutually exclusive; so if isMpi is true, then cmdPrefix must not be set.
