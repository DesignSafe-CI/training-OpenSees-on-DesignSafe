# Corral
***Storage on Corral (DesignSafe Data Portal)***

For **long-term, collaborative, and cross-platform data management**, DesignSafe uses **Corral**, a dedicated storage system fully integrated with the DesignSafe interface. This is where most research data is organized and accessed outside of compute jobs.

* **Advantage**: Versatility — accessible via the DesignSafe web interface, Tapis, JupyterHub, and multiple systems.
* **Limitation**: Slightly lower I/O performance than system-local storage, so it’s not ideal for active job execution.

Corral offers a versatile and structured way to organize and access data:

* **MyData** – Your personal, private storage space.
* **Community Data** – Public datasets shared openly with the DesignSafe community.
* **Projects** – Collaborative storage where team members can access shared files.
* **Published** – Finalized datasets that are publicly accessible and assigned DOIs for citation.
* and more....

You can access Corral from the Data Depot, the Jupyter Hub, or the OpenSees Interactive VM.

This architecture allows for better **cross-platform access**, **data sharing**, and **publishing workflows**, making Corral the preferred data hub in the DesignSafe ecosystem.
