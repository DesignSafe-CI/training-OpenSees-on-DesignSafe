# ADCIRC app

**ADCIRC** is a widely used high-performance model for simulating coastal storm surge, tides, and other hydrodynamic flows. It solves large-scale systems with complex meshes and often requires **hundreds or thousands of cores** to run efficiently.

Running ADCIRC on an HPC system like Stampede3 is challenging because:

* You need to prepare multiple specialized input files: meshes (e.g. `fort.14`), boundary conditions (`fort.15`), forcing data (`fort.61`...), and more.
* The solver requires careful MPI configuration, meaning you must write precise **SLURM batch scripts** that set up the parallel environment correctly.
* You have to manually stage your input files to the **scratch** space on the compute cluster (for high I/O speed), execute the solver, and then gather the output files.
* If you want to run multiple storm scenarios (for example in an ensemble study), you have to carefully manage directories, job submissions, and resource allocation to avoid collisions and maximize throughput.

## The ADCIRC app on DesignSafe automates this

The **ADCIRC app on the DesignSafe Web Portal** was created to eliminate these complexities. It provides:

* **A web-based interface to upload your ADCIRC input files**, including your domain meshes, tidal and meteorological forcings, and control parameters.
* **Automatic generation of the SLURM submission script**, correctly configured for your requested number of cores and wall time.
* **Automatic staging of your files** to the compute cluster’s scratch space, so that ADCIRC reads and writes at maximum speed.
* Execution of the solver with MPI across your allocated nodes.
* **Returning all result files** back into your DesignSafe workspace (**My Data**), organized for easy retrieval or further analysis.

This means you can run powerful storm surge or tidal simulations on thousands of cores, directly from a browser — without needing to write SLURM or MPI commands by hand.

## Where to find the app’s code

Like all DesignSafe apps, the ADCIRC application is open source and hosted in the DesignSafe GitHub organization [WMA-Tapis-Templates](https://github.com/TACC/WMA-Tapis-Templates/tree/main/applications):

The repository includes:

* JSON schemas that define what input files and parameters the app expects.
* Templates for SLURM scripts configured specifically for large-scale MPI runs of ADCIRC.
* Environment specifications to load the correct ADCIRC binaries and supporting libraries on TACC systems.

Reviewing this code is an excellent way to see exactly **how your web inputs translate into HPC job submissions**, which is very helpful when you want to transition to more advanced workflows (like running ensembles via custom automation).

## Summary: why use the ADCIRC app?

| Without the app                                   | With the ADCIRC app on DesignSafe                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Must write detailed SLURM + MPI scripts by hand   | Submission script created for you automatically  |
| Manually copy meshes and forcing files to scratch | Inputs staged to scratch for fast execution      |
| Handle complex MPI decompositions directly        | App manages MPI environment and process layout   |
| Manually retrieve potentially huge result files   | Outputs automatically copied back to **My Data** |

The app streamlines all these steps, letting you focus on the science — building better surge models and analyzing impacts — rather than on cluster mechanics.
